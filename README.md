###  Mini-Project-3
This mini project is a blog website based off of the flask tutorial from https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/.

My project is meant to be a sports betting blog page when users can register and submit sports picks that they like so others users can comment on them or take the same picks as the original poster.

### Gettings Started  
Users should run the command **pip install -r requirments.txt** to install all needed packages

Users should then run the code **flask --app flaskr init-db** to initialize the database

Finally to run the code locally users need to run the code **flask --app flaskr run** users should then be running the project on port 5000
